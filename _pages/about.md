Hi! My name is Camilla and I am a computational linguistics and NLP postdoctoral researcher at the <a href='https://dh.fbk.eu/'>Digital Humanities group</a> @ Fondazione Bruno Kessler in Trento, Italy. 

My research interests include (but are not limited to):
- Fairness and bias issues in NLP
- Synthetic data for subjective NLP tasks
- NLP for social media and non-standard language
- Qualitative analyses of both data and model outputs

Previously, I was a PhD student at Fondazione Bruno Kessler and University of Trento, supervised by **Sara Tonelli**. My PhD 
was focused on the strengths and weaknesses of using synthetic data for abusive language detection online.

You can reach me at `ccasula[at]fbk.eu`.
