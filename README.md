This is the repo for my personal website, based on the [al-folio](https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/) theme, a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme for academics.

Originally, al-folio was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](https://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license).
